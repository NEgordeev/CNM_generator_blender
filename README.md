Carbon nanomaterials generator v1.0

For CNTs you may want to adjust an agle a little bit in simple deform modificator, since now it is a simple linear approximation
For CNT films for now you may want to use a boolean cube (or any other shape) to adjust the angles

If you want to deform your tube, place any deform modifiers before the geometry node
