Carbon nanomaterials generator v1.0

For the CNTs you may want to adjust an agle a little bit in simple deform modificator, since now it is a simple linear approximation
For the CNT films for now you may want to use a boolean cube (or any other shape) to adjust the angles
For the CNT films you also need to install Blender add-on called "Extra Curve Objects", since it uses bounce spline from it. I am not an author of this add-on and you may want to check the website: https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/extra-curve-objectes/?utm_source=blender-4.5.3-lts

If you want to deform your tube, place any deform modifiers before the geometry node
